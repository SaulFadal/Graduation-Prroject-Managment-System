# Graduation-Prroject-Managment-System

This project addresses graduation project procedures and its related
processes in FCIS (Faculty of Computer Science and Information
System), making it electronically instead of the current process which
mainly depends on setting up meetings with students and requires
students and supervisors to attend college for the submission of
graduation project related material. The implementation of this project
will save a significant amount of time and effort for students, supervisors
and GPC (Graduation Project Committee).
